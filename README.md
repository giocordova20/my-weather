# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

The My Weather application utilizes the OpenWeather api to get city weather and five day forecast information. It will search for city weather based on zip code or city and state search. All city searches are saved to local storage so that the search is persistent. The application is responsive on displays the same information on smaller screens. It displays weather icons and changes the color of the UV Index value based on intensity.	

I used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.
